<h1>The Internet Archive: System Evaluation</h1>
<h3>By Izzy Ruiz </h3>

<h2>System Introduction</h2>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;"> <a href="https://archive.org/">The Internet Archive</a> is a digital library of internet sites, cultural artifacts, and books in digital form. It began back in 1996 when the internet was first beginning to grow exponentially in use. While the archive does have employees to work on uploading, organizing, digitizing, and cataloging media, it is also a system where anyone on the internet can upload an addition to the collection with metadata. They are supported by grants and donations, and also offer a digitization service to partner institutions.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Within the Internet Archive, there is not necessarily a target user demographic, and it is intended to be used by anyone and everyone around the world to have free access to information on the internet. The Internet Archive is very large, and a single copy of the Internet Archive library collection occupies 145+ Petabytes of server space. The Internet Archive provides many different collections of items, including but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>835 billion web pages</li>
<li>44 million books and texts</li>
<li>15 million audio recordings (including 255,000 live concerts)</li>
<li>10.6 million videos (including 2.6 million Television News programs)</li>
<li>4.8 million images</li>
<li>1 million software programs</li>
</ul>

<h2>Further Findings</h2>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">One of my favorite aspects of the collection is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a>, which is a way to see archived versions of websites in their original forms. It uses web crawlers to archive and discover websites, then takes a snapshot of the website with a timestamp, and over time, you can also see how the webpage has changed from when the crawler captured the image. 
They have also introduced a new beta uploader that allows users to upload materials for the collection and even edit their own metadata in a very easy and cohesive manner. It also allows uploaders to preset standard metadata fields such as title and description, as well as arbitrary key/value pairs. 
</p>

<h3>Pro's of the System</h3>
<ul>
<li>The system has a good search engine with the ability to narrow down your search with filters and browse through whole collections easily.</li>
<li>It is also constantly being updated, and is a great resource for digital objects that would be lost to the web due to no longer being kept up to date or the website was no longer suitable for modern browsers. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Con's of the System</h3>
<ul>
<li>The “check out” system for some books is an unfriendly user system. They usually have a one-hour time limit, and then you will have to check it out again. It can also limit researchers on a time crunch if a piece of media is being checked out by another person.</li>
<li>The Platform has also had many copyright lawsuits in the past couple of years, such as the case of Hachette v. Internet Archive and a 700 million dollar lawsuit by major record labels. While it doesn’t necessarily hurt the credibility of the system itself, it brings in many questions about how the system screens for copyright infringement in its database.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I do not have any real suggestions for improvement when it comes to the information system for the Internet Archive. I have been using this system for a while now, and it is an amazing platform that provides a wide variety of services for its users. However, there are some bugs in the website design itself. On the about page, the news text on the left sidebar overlaps with the actual body text and makes it hard to read. For such a huge organization, that seems like an oversight that shouldn't have happened.
